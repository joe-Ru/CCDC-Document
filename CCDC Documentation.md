# SECCDC Documentation Panic Guide

## About

 *What the hell is a case change? Is this an Incident Response? Is this case change three? What happens if I do X, Y, Z?*

This guide is to inform the contestants about which documents to use, how to use them and what to do in for each case so that a quick glance at this document will give the contestants a general idea of which document to use.

# Change Management/Request

What is Change Management? Simply put, change management is a way to log, categorize and analyze each change completed to a system. Reason being is that these systems are *corporate owned* so therefore it would be in our best interest to ensure that we log any changes. 

Simply put: If a change is undocumented, then it *could* be a potential attacker.

The Change Control Committee (CCC) approves any changes, however the Corporate Change Control Manager (CCM) and the Corporate CIO can veto any change request.

Case 1: Requires approval of the HAL CCC to implement
Case 2: Requires notification to the HAL CCC **after** implementation
Case 3: Change that does not require any notification to the HAL CCC
Case 4: Change that is uncertain whether or not it requires interaction with the CCC.


### How to complete it




The artifact used to monitor these changes is the **Change Journal**. This log is then handed over to the company for an in-depth analysis.
